1.3 release checklist:
 * Fill in current_w and current_h with desktop display mode
	([SDL] SDL_VideoInfo in 1.3 missing elements)
 * Implement YUV texture support
 * Implement desktop video mode change notification?

Wish list for the 1.3 development branch:
http://bugzilla.libsdl.org/

 * Add a way to register custom events
 * Add internal support for adding video modes and refresh rates
 * Support querying and setting refresh rate with video modes
 * Add mousewheel events (new unified event architecture?)
 * DirectInput joystick support needs to be implemented
 * Be able to enumerate and select available audio and video drivers
 * Fullscreen video mode support for Mac OS X
 * Explicit vertical retrace wait (maybe separate from SDL_Flip?)
 * Shaped windows, windows without borders
 * Multiple windows, multiple display support
 * SDL_INIT_EVENTTHREAD on Windows and MacOS?
 * Add a timestamp to events
 * Add audio input API
 * Add hardware accelerated scaled blit
 * Add hardware accelerated alpha blits
 * Redesign blitting architecture to allow blit plugins
 * Add modifier state to key and button events

In the jump from 1.2 to 1.3, we should change the SDL_Rect members to
int and evaluate all the rest of the datatypes.  This is the only place
we should do it though, since the 1.2 series should not break binary
compatibility in this way.

Requests:
 * PCM and CDROM volume control (deprecated, but possible)
